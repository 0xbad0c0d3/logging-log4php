            Log4php is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), 
            sponsored by the Apache Logging Services project. 
            Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review 
            indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process 
            have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 
            While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or 
            stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be 
            fully endorsed by the ASF.
