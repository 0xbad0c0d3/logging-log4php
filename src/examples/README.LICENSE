The files in this directory do not carry the Apache Licese header as they
* are just snippets which are supposed to be included into the phpdoc and
  .apt site documentation files where the headers would look ugly
* have no degree of creativity and are thus not protected by copyright law
* are examples of what the endusers are expected to write in their programs
  and they certainly do not want us to claim copyright on that :)
